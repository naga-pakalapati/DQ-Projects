### Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQLite and Python

We'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:

- population - The population as of 2015.
- population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
- area - The total land and water area.

In guided project, we'll explore the Python SQLite workflow to explore, analyze, and visualize data from this database.
